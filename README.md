# Polkadot Learning Path

-- Work in progress --

A simplified learning path for getting to understand blockchain and the Polkadot Ecosystem. It's important that this is a suggestion you can follow, but it's not the only way. You can follow this path or you can follow your own path. The important thing is to learn and understand the technology. The are may be some concepts that you would understand the second time you read them, so don't be afraid to read them again.

If you are not developer you can skip the parts where the people talk about code.

PR, questions and comments are welcome !

## Cryptography
